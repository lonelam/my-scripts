# ⚠️ Important Warning

**This script and its associated configuration files are tailored specifically for my personal server setup and use cases.**

**Using these scripts directly on your own server without proper modification will not work and may cause unintended consequences, including system misconfiguration or security vulnerabilities.**

## **Why You Should Not Use This Script As-Is**

- **Custom Configurations**: The script contains hard-coded domain names, IP addresses, and service configurations that are unique to my environment.
- **Personal API Keys and Secrets**: It prompts for API keys, secrets, and other confidential information specific to my accounts (e.g., Porkbun API credentials).
- **Specific Services and Paths**: References to services, directories, and file paths (like `/www/aiweb` or `192.168.6.6`) are unique to my server and network topology.
- **Security Risks**: Running this script without understanding and modifying it appropriately can expose your server to security risks or cause service interruptions.

## **For Those Interested in Similar Functionality**

If you're looking to set up a server with similar capabilities:

1. **Use This Script as a Reference Only**: Treat the `setup_server.sh` script and the configuration files as examples to understand the steps involved.
2. **Thoroughly Review and Modify**: Before running any part of the script, read through it carefully and adjust all configurations to suit your own domains, services, IP addresses, and directory structures.
3. **Replace Confidential Information**: Ensure that any placeholders or hard-coded credentials are replaced with your own secure information.
4. **Test in a Safe Environment**: Consider setting up a test environment or using virtual machines to trial the script modifications before deploying them to a production server.
5. **Backup Your Data**: Always back up important data and configurations before making significant changes to your server.
